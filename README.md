# 3D Function Grapher

A web-based application that visualizes 3D mathematical functions using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project graphs any function of the form `z = f(x, y)` and supports parametric geometry rendering.

## Features

- Graphs 3D surfaces like:
  - Cone shapes (`z = x² + y²`)
  - Hyperbolic paraboloids (`z = x² - y²`)
- Interactive 3D rendering with rotation and zoom capabilities.
- Easy to modify for other mathematical functions.
- Lightweight and runs directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Internet connection (to fetch the Three.js library)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Clinzho1996/cs4406.git
   cd 3d-function-grapher
   ```
